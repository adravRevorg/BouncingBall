# Bouncing Ball
Bouncing ball model and simulation in 3d. 
1. 3D [basic]
2. 3D [with plane collisions]

Some of the features include : 
Variation 1 : 
- Collision detection, determination, response and resting condition
- Includes gravity, air resistance, friction calculations
- Euler integration, with random step sizes, to show that code has consistent simulation time step, irrespective of step size
- Mouse click anywhere on the screen would create a wind as per a function of mouse click position
- Key press to increase/decrease radius and mass

Variation 2 :
In addition to the features in variation 1 : 
- Ball bouncing in a 3d cube
- Color of cube's face changes when the ball collides with it
- Has UI options like pause, continue, show distance lines from plane, reset, move camera
